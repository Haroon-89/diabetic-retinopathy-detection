# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System

**Live Demo:** [https://diabetic-retinopathy-detection-89.streamlit.app/](https://diabetic-retinopathy-detection-89.streamlit.app/)

An AI-powered web application for automated detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images using deep learning.

## Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes, potentially leading to blindness if left untreated. This application uses a deep learning model based on EfficientNetB3 architecture to automatically detect signs of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.

**Key Statistics:**
- **Model Accuracy:** 96.97%
- **AUC Score:** 0.995
- **Architecture:** EfficientNetB3
- **Training Time:** ~14 minutes

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Single Image Analysis**: Upload and analyze individual retinal images
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images simultaneously
- **Confidence Scores**: View prediction confidence with visual progress bars
- **Downloadable Reports**: Generate detailed text reports for each analysis
- **CSV Export**: Download batch analysis results in CSV format

### User Interface
- Modern, responsive design with gradient styling
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Real-time progress indicators
- Interactive data visualization
- Educational information about Diabetic Retinopathy

### Technical Features
- Fast inference using TensorFlow/Keras
- Automatic image preprocessing

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (optional)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haroon-89/diabetic-retinopathy-detection.git
cd diabetic-retinopathy-detection
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Download Model Files

Download the trained model files and place them in the `models/` directory:

1. **best_model.h5** or **dr_model_final.h5** - The trained model
2. **metadata.json** - Model metadata

### Step 5: Verify Installation with Test Images

The repository includes sample test images for verification:
- **DR positive images**: `dr1.jpg` to `dr5.jpg`
- **No DR images**: `n_dr.jpg`, `n_dr2.jpg`, `n_dr3.jpg`

Use these images to test the application functionality.

## Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Single Image Analysis

1. Click on "Choose a retinal fundus image"
2. Select a retinal image (JPG, JPEG, or PNG)
3. Click "Analyze Image" button
4. View the prediction results and confidence score
5. Download the detailed report (optional)

### Batch Processing

1. Expand the "Batch Analysis (Multiple Images)" section
2. Upload multiple retinal images
3. Click "Process All Images"
4. View results in a table format
5. Download CSV report with all results

### Testing with Sample Images

The application includes test images in the `sample_images/` folder:

**Diabetic Retinopathy Positive Images:**
- `dr1.jpg` - `dr5.jpg`: Images with signs of diabetic retinopathy

**No Diabetic Retinopathy Images:**
- `n_dr.jpg`, `n_dr2.jpg`, `n_dr3.jpg`: Healthy retinal images

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# After starting the app, try these tests:
1. Upload sample_images/dr1.jpg → Should detect DR
2. Upload sample_images/n_dr.jpg → Should show No DR
3. Batch process all 8 sample images → Should show mixed results
```

### Image Upload Issues

**Error:** Image fails to process

**Solution:**
- Ensure image is in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format
- Check image is not corrupted
- Verify image is a valid retinal fundus image
- Try with provided sample images first to verify setup

### Testing the Application

To verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
# 1. Start the application
streamlit run app.py

# 2. Test with provided samples
# Upload: sample_images/dr1.jpg → Expected: DR Detected
# Upload: sample_images/n_dr.jpg → Expected: No DR

# 3. Test batch processing
# Upload all 8 sample images → Expected: 5 DR, 3 No DR
```
